# About
Anything put here will automatically be available in a request.
Don't put dynamic pages here, they won't change.

***ALSO***
A lot of temporary files are still being used. (The 'www' folder).
These are still sent.

## Example
The file path:
```
./static/css/anything.css
```

Will resolve to:

```
localhost:3000/css/anything.css
```

Try going to this URL:
```
localhost:3000/README.md
```
