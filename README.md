# Prerequisites

Install all packages first:

```
npm install
```

> Someone might have added something new to the project.

# Starting the server

With NodeJS installed, put this into a terminal in the project folder:

To find any link you can access, visit the sitemap:
```
localhost:8080/sitemap
```
